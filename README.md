# Crowdfunding_Prediction
## Aims to build strong predictive models that can  anticipate the critical opportunity of getting enough funds.

One of the biggest challenges for project owners is to raise enough funding to support the 
work progress. Therefore, the goal of this project is to build strong predictive models that can 
anticipate the critical opportunity of getting enough funds.

Steps:
  1.  Develop a classification model (i.e., a supervised-learning model where the target variable is a categorical variable) to predict whether the variable “state” will take the value “successful” or “failure.”
  2.  Develop a clustering model (i.e., an unsupervised-learning model which can group observations together) to group projects together.
 
The dataset in this project is scraped from Kickstarter, which is a popular crowdfunding platform.
